A simple but powerful recommended book plugin.


== Description ==

BookX creates an easy way to give your site visitors a peek at your recommended books.  Using only ISBN numbers, it gets the
information from Barnes and Noble (http://www.bn.com) and stores the information locally to both speed up the response time, but
also to not bog down their servers with repetetive requests.  BookX creates a widget for your sidebar, a list view, and detail view, 
all customizable from the easy to use admin interface.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the bookx directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Under the Tools menu, go to the 'BookX' administration page 
4. Now all you need to do is start adding your book's ISBN numbers.
