This plugin grabs the contents of your CellarTracker wine cellar once a day and stores it on your server
allowing your users to see your wine cellar on your site, in your theme.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the winex directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Under "Manage" in the Administration area, update the WineX page with your CellarTracker Member #
5. At CellarTracker.com, once you are logged in, go to "My Account" then "Privacy Settings".  You will need
to set your "privacy level" to low in order for your webserver to get the cellar contents.
